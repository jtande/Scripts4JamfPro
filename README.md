# Scripts for Command Line Installation Application installation on MacOs
If you are tasked with deploying applications on mac computers, you need every 
piece of information available to help you accomplish this task. In an academic 
environment, software come from all angle and you need to be able to install them 
at a time noticed. This is a documentation of some scripts I have used and I hope it 
helps make your life better. Some of the scripts were initially written by someone 
else but I have modified for my own needs and I encourage you to use mine as it best 
fits your need.

Scripts in this repository:
